			Welcome to <b>SimuVid</b>!
			<br>
			This is just a simple application to watch local videos (videos that live on your machine) with your friends.
			<br><br>
			To start, <a href="/" >go Home</a>, fill in the channel info (<small>name and password</small>) and press <b>"Create"</b>.
			<br>
			It'll automatically connect you to your freshly created channel if you chose an original name (<i>or at least one that isn't being used</i>).
			<br>
			From there you can choose the <b>file</b> you want to watch and/or copy the <b>channel's link</b> to the clipboard.
			<br>
			Share that link with the ones you want to watch the video with and they will connect directly to your room through it.
			<br>
			You can also share the channel's name and password and let them join from <a href="/" >Home</a> by clicking on <b>"Connect"</b> instead of "Create".
			<br><br>
			Have a nice stay and happy watching! c:
